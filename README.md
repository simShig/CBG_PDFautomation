Before starting:
update the next PATH variables to match your system:
  
     excel_file_path
  
     output_dir_path
  
     logs_dir_path

for rotating-ip proxy you need to change:

    bla bla bla


TBD:
- handling CAPTHA - rotating-ip proxy omplementation&test
- catching URL - needs to checked (whether catches all of them)
- saving file - works fine
- marking progress in table - yet to be done, shows row on printing
